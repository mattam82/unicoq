(** Given a set of evars s and terms t1 t2, it unifies the terms only
    allowing instantiations from the evars in t1 and s, and only
    allowing reduction on the t2. The idea is that t1 acts as a
    "pattern" (for pattern matching), so only the variables in t1 are
    instantiated, as long as they occur in s, and only the scrutinee
    (t2) is reduced.  *)
